DAG-only deploys are the fastest way to deploy code to Astro. They are recommended if you only need to deploy changes made to the `dags` directory of your Astro project.

DAG-only deploys are enabled by default on all Deployments on Astro Hosted. After it is enabled, you must still [deploy your project image](deploy-project-image.md) when you make a change to any file in your Astro project that is not in the `dags` directory.

DAG-only deploys have the following benefits:

- DAG-only deploys are significantly faster than project deploys.
- Deployments pick up DAG-only deploys without restarting. This results in a more efficient use of workers and no downtime for your Deployments.
- If you have a CI/CD process that includes both DAG and image-based deploys, you can use your repository's permissions to control which users can perform which kinds of deploys. See [DAG deploy templates](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/ci-cd-templates/template-overview#dag-deploy-templates) for how you can set this up in your CI/CD pipelines.
- You can use DAG deploys to update your DAGs when you have slow upload speed on your internet connection.

## Trigger a DAG-only deploy

Triggering a DAG-only deploy pushes DAGs to Astro and mounts them to the workers and schedulers in your Deployment. DAG-only deploys do not disrupt running tasks and do not cause any components to restart when you push code. If you deploy changes to a DAG that is currently running, active task runs finish executing according to the code from before you triggered a deploy. New task runs are scheduled using the code from your latest deploy.

Run the following command to deploy only your `dags` directory to a Deployment:

```sh
astro deploy --dags
```

## Toggle DAG-only deploys on a Deployment

As a Workspace Owner, you can enable or disable DAG-only deploys for a Deployment. On Astro Hosted, DAG-only deploys are enabled by default for all Deployments. On Astro Hybrid, you must enable them manually for each Deployment. 
  
To determine if disabling DAG-only deploy functionality is the right choice for your organization, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support). 

### Prerequisites

Before you enable or disable DAG-only deploys on a Deployment, ensure the following:

- You have Workspace Owner permissions for the Workspace that hosts the Deployment. 
- You have access to the latest version of your Deployment's Astro project.
- You can update your Deployment using the Astro CLI. 

### Enable DAG-only deploys

:::warning

Carefully read and complete all of the following steps to ensure that your Deployment is not disrupted by disabling or enabling DAG-only deploys. Crucially, you must trigger an image deploy to your Astro Deployment using `astro deploy` immediately after you apply the setting. If you don't, your DAGs will be not be available in the Airflow UI until you update your Deployment.

:::

When you enable DAG-only deploys and trigger a code deploy: 

- You can run `astro deploy --dags` to deploy only DAGs to your Deployment.
- In the Cloud UI, your Deployment **DAG bundle version** updates when you trigger both image deploys and DAG-only deploys. 
- Your Deployment includes infrastructure for deploying your DAGs separately from your project image. See [What happens during a code deploy](deploy-project-image.md#what-happens-during-a-project-deploy).

1. Run the following command to enable DAG-only deploys:

    ```sh
    astro deployment update --dag-deploy enable
    ```

2. Run the following command to deploy all of the files in your Astro project as a Docker image:

    ```sh
    astro deploy
    ```

### Disable DAG-only deploys 

:::warning

Carefully read and complete all of the following steps to ensure that your Deployment is not disrupted by disabling or enabling DAG-only deploys. Crucially, you must trigger an image deploy to your Astro Deployment using `astro deploy` immediately after you apply the setting. If you don't, your DAGs will be not be available in the Airflow UI until you update your Deployment.

:::

When you disable DAG-only deploys and trigger a code deploy: 

- You can no longer run `astro deploy --dags` to trigger a DAG-only deploy to your Deployment.
- Any changes to your DAG code are deployed as part of your Astro project Docker image.
- In the Cloud UI, your Deployment **DAG bundle version** doesn't update when you deploy code. 
- Your Deployment no longer includes infrastructure for deploying your DAGs separately from your project image. See [What happens during a code deploy](deploy-project-image.md#what-happens-during-a-project-deploy).

1. Run the following command to disable DAG-only deploys:

    ```sh
    astro deployment update --dag-deploy disable
    ```

2. Run the following command to deploy all of the files in your Astro project as a Docker image:

    ```sh
    astro deploy
    ```
