## 0.33.0

Release date: August 3, 2023

### Automatic PGBouncer connection scaling

Astronomer Software now automatically scales the size of PGBouncer connection pools based on your Airflow component counts and Airflow configuration, instead of solely based on total AU. This improves performance, scalability, and utilization of database connections across all Deployments. 

### Additional improvements

- You can now disable Airflow and platform alerts on the Prometheus alerts dashboard by setting `prometheus.defaultAlerts.airflow.enabled` and `prometheus.defaultAlerts.airflow.enabled` to `false` in your Prometheus Helm chart. If you disable these alerts, you can still add back specific alerts or configure custom alerts using `prometheus.defaultAlerts.additionalAlerts`. See [Create custom alerts](platform-alerts.md#create-custom-alerts).
- Added support for [Kubernetes 1.27](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/11/kubernetes-v1-27-release/).
- The Workspace **Deployments** page is now paginated in the Astronomer UI.
- The **Extra Capacity** field in the Astronomer UI now shows up to 6 digits of AU.
- You no longer have to set `elasticsearch.curator.age.timestring` when you configure a custom indexing pattern for [Vector logging sidecars](export-task-logs.md#export-logs-using-container-sidecars). The only required value is now `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.helm.loggingSidecar.indexPattern`.
- When you create or update a Deployment and select a Runtime version, the Astronomer UI now shows only the latest supported Astro Runtime patch for each supported Astro Runtime major version.
- You can now set `deployments.canUpsertDeploymentFromUI: false` to prevent all users besides System Admins from updating Deployments and environment variables through the Astronomer UI.
- You can now [overprovision](cluster-resource-provisioning.md) the `triggerer-log-groomer` component.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where a Deployment using Runtime 8 or earlier with the Celery executor would show as healthy in the Software UI even when workers were unavailable.
- Fixed an issue where Grafana could not start up on an OpenShift cluster.
- Fixed an issue where configurations in `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.components` applied only to Deployments that were created after the configuration was set. 
- Fixed an issue where a Workspace-level service account would improperly inherit lesser permissions for Deployments it was added to.
- The Astronomer UI now shows an error if you click the **Delete** button for Teams and you don't have the `system.teams.remove` permission.

## 0.32.0

Release date: April 28, 2023

### Clean Deployment task metadata

You can now clean task data from your Deployments by exporting it to an external storage service. This workflow reduces the amount of data Airflow stores in your Deployment metadata database by archiving data that you don't need to access on a regular basis. To configure this job, see [Clean Deployment task metadata](configure-deployment.md#clean-deployment-task-metadata).

### Programmatically create and update Deployments with the Houston API

You can now programmatically create or update Deployments using the Houston API `upsertDeployment` mutation. Unlike `createDeployment`, the `upsertDeployment` mutation includes keys for configuring Deployment resources such as environment variables. See [Create or update a Deployment with configurations](houston-api.md#create-or-update-a-deployment-with-configurations).

### Reduce resource requests for Airflow components in development environments

You can reduce the amount of CPU and memory that an Airflow component requests in development environments, allowing you to more efficiently provision resources based on the requirements for your development Deployments. See [Underprovision Airflow resources](cluster-resource-provisioning) for configuration steps.

### New cron job to clean Deployment task data

You can now clean task data from your Deployments by exporting it to an external storage service. This workflow reduces the amount of storage Astronomer Software uses by archiving data that you don't need to access on a regular basis. See [Configure a Deployment](configure-deployment.md#clean-deployment-task-metadata) for configuration steps.

### Assign System-level permissions to Teams

You can assign the System Admin, System Editor, and System Viewer permissions to teams by setting the following values in your `config.yaml` file:

```sh
# Auth configuration.
auth:
  openidConnect:
    idpGroupsImportEnabled: true
    # Optional configuration. Set to assign System-level permissions using Teams.
    manageSystemPermissionsViaIdpGroups:
      enabled: true
      systemAdmin: ["<your-system-admin-groups>"] // Only these groups will be treated as SysAdmin Groups
      systemEditor: ["<your-system-editor-groups>"]
      systemViewer: ["<your-system-viewer-groups>"]
```

When coupled with [disabling individual user management](import-idp-groups.md#disable-individual-user-management), this feature allows you to control all user permissions on Astronomer Software exclusively through your identity provider. For more information, see [Import IdP groups](import-idp-groups.md).

### PostgreSQL 15

Astronomer Software version 0.32 upgrades PostgreSQL from 11.18.0-1 to 15. If you use in-cluster PostgreSQL for your workflows, upgrading to Software 0.32 without pinning your PostgreSQL version can impact your workflows. See the [Upgrade to Postgres 15](upgrade-astronomer.md#upgrade-to-postgres-15) for upgrade considerations and steps.

### Additional improvements

- Added support for using git-sync with a private image registry.
- The root user feature introduced in Astronomer Software version 0.31 has been deprecated. System Admins now have the highest level of permissions on the platform.
- Workspaces are now required to have unique names. If you have existing Workspaces with identical names, upon upgrade the duplicate names will be appended with an underscore and a number.
- If you configured [git-sync deploys](deploy-git-sync.md) for a Deployment, you can now [view error logs](deployment-logs.md) emitted from the git-sync Kubernetes Pod in the Software UI.
- You can now configure a custom indexing pattern for [Vector logging sidecars](export-task-logs.md#export-logs-using-container-sidecars) by setting both `elasticsearch.curator.age.timestring` and `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.helm.loggingSidecar.indexPattern` in your `config.yaml` file.
- You can now configure custom environment variables for ElasticSearch-based custom logging using the `astronomer.customLogging.extraEnv` value in your `config.yaml` file.
- The `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.sysAdminScalabilityImprovementsEnabled` key has been replaced with `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.performanceOptimizationModeEnabled`  for improved performance across additional Software UI views.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where ElasticSearch Curator version 7 and later did not work as expected.
- Fixed an issue where sidecar containers would sometimes not terminate properly after their primary container was terminated.
- Fixed an issue in the Software UI where you could not view Deployment details for a Deployment that included "team" in its name.
- Fixed an issue where a service account with Workspace Editor permissions could update Deployments. 
- Fixed an issue where Prometheus was using more memory than expected due to a misconfiguration of statsd.
Fixed an issue in the Software UI where a text search returned duplicate entries for a single Deployment name.
- Fixed an issue where authentication tokens were visible in Nginx logs produced by the Software UI.
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:

    - [CVE-2022-46146](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46146)

## 0.31.0

Release date: December 7, 2022

### View and export task usage metrics

You can now view task usage metrics from the Software UI.

Task usage metrics provide an overview of your Airflow task runs and can help you quickly identify Deployments where more tasks are running or failing than expected. 

To configure the feature, see [Set up task usage metrics](task-usage-metrics.md).

### New root user role

Astronomer Software's role-based access control (RBAC) system now supports a single root user for each installation. The root user has a non-configurable username and autogenerated password stored as a Kubernetes secret in your installation. 

See [Manage the root user](https://docs.astronomer.io/software/0.31/manage-root-user#log-in-as-the-root-user).

### Manage Astronomer users through a SCIM integration 

Astronomer Software now supports managing users through System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM), which allows you to automatically provision and deprovision users based on templates for access and permissions. See [Manage users with SCIM](integrate-auth-system.md#manage-users-and-teams-with-scim).

### Invite users only through Teams

Using the new root user feature, you can now configure Astronomer Software so that users are managed exclusively through Teams. This helps you better integrate with your identity provider (IdP) by ensuring that all users on your platform are authenticated and managed through the IdP. See [Disable individual user management](import-idp-groups.md#disable-individual-user-management).

### New default resource limits and requests 

Astronomer Software 0.31 includes new default resource limits and requests on the following resources: 

- Alertmanager
- Elasticsearch
- NATS
- PostrgeSQL
- STAN
- Nginx
- Grafana
- Blackbox exporter

You might experience OOMKill errors or unexpected behavior after upgrading if you use resources beyond the new default limits. To minimize disruption, view resource usage for these components in [Grafana](grafana-metrics.md) prior to upgrade and compare this usage to the default resource limits in the [Astronomer Helm chart](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer/blob/master/charts/astronomer/values.yaml). 

If your current usage is expected and higher than the default resource limits, update the limits in your `config.yaml` file before upgrading to Astronomer Software 0.31.

### Additional improvements 

- You can now set a custom security context for `es-client` by setting `elasticsearch.client.securityContext.capabilities.add={}` in the ElasticSearch Helm chart.
- The **Deployment users** page is now paginated in the Software UI.
- You can now set `astronomer.registry.logLevel` to filter which types of logs appear in your Docker registry.
- The default Git-sync interval is now 1 instead of 0.
- You can now configure a Deployment to have 0 triggerer components.
- You can now set `astronomer.houston.config.useAutoCompleteForSensativeFields=false` to disable autocomplete on sensitive fields in the Software UI.
- You can now set `astronomer.houston.config.shouldLogUsername=true` to include user email addresses in audit logs for logins through the Houston API.
- [Git sync-based Deployments](deploy-git-sync.md) now have a dedicated git-sync relay pod, service, and network policy.
  
### Bug fixes

- The Software UI now stores user tokens with `httpOnly` and `secure` flags.
- Fixed an issue where the Software UI would occasionally show an incorrect **Extra AU** number for Deployments. 
- Fixed the following vulnerabilities:

    - [CVE-2022-37601](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LOADERUTILS-3043105)

## 0.30.0

Release date: August 29, 2022

:::danger Breaking Change for Azure Database for PostgreSQL

A change in 0.30 enabled the `trgm` extension for PostgreSQL. If you use Azure Database for PostgreSQL as your database backend, you need to enable the `pg_trgm` extension before upgrading to Software 0.30 using either Azure portal or the Azure CLI. See [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-extensions) for configuration steps.

If you don't complete this setup before your upgrade, the upgrade will fail.

:::

### Improved token refreshing for IdP integrations

The Software UI now refreshes your JSON web token (JWT) based on the validity of your authentication token from your IdP. This means that as long as you stay logged in to your IdP, you no longer have to refresh the Software UI to continue accessing the Software UI, Astro CLI, and Houston API.

Additionally, if you change a user's access to Astronomer from your IdP, their permissions will be automatically updated in Astronomer after their current IdP token expires. If you remove a user completely from Astronomer, they are automatically logged out of the Software UI and CLI after their current IdP token expires.

As part of this change, you can now configure `jwt.authDuration` in your [Houston Helm configuration](https://github.com/astronomer/docs/blob/main/software_configs/0.30/default.yaml). If a user is logged on longer than `authDuration`, they will be immediately logged out regardless of the status of their JWT or authentication token.

### Additional improvements

- Workspace users are now paginated in the Software UI.
- You can now configure credentials for a private image registry by specifying a secret you create instead of a username and password. The secret is attached to any Pods that need to access the registry.
- You can now specify `authUrlParams` for your identity provider (IdP) in `config.yaml`.
- System Editors can no longer manage Teams or users in a Workspace. These permissions are now available only at the System Admin level.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where `updateRuntimeCheck.enabled:false` did not properly stop an Astronomer Software installation from checking for Runtime updates. 
- Fixed an issue where applying an IAM role to a Deployment would reset the Deployment's **Extra Capacity** setting back to the default of 0 AU.
- Fixed an issue where System Admins could receive an error when trying to view a Team imported from a different IdP than their current one.
- When a System Admin makes a change to a Team, that change now appears in the UI without needing to refresh the page.
- Configurations for disabling a specific executor type in `config.yaml` are now reflected in the Software UI.
- Fixed an issue where Workspace-level service accounts could view Deployment information from Deployments outside of their Workspace.
- Fixed an issue where updating the role of a user in a Team using the Astro CLI would not throw an error as expected.
- Fixed an issue where JSON web tokens persisted after a user logged out if `idpGroupsRefreshEnabled` was set to `false`.
- Users authenticating with Google Direct are no longer automatically logged out of Astronomer Software after 1 hour.

- Users added to Astronomer Software via an [IDP group](import-idp-groups.md) no longer need to be invited by email in order to join Astronomer.
- Teams now support [Azure AD Connect sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/concept-azure-ad-connect-sync-user-and-contacts) for user groups.
- System admins can no longer remove the last user from an active Workspace or Deployment. This ensures that a given Workspace or Deployment can always be deleted by an existing member. Similarly, Workspace Admins can no longer remove a Team if doing so results in a Workspace having zero Admins.
- You can now map your IDP's groups claim to Astronomer's expected claim of `groups` via the `astronomer.houston.config.auth.openidConnect.<idp>.claimsMapping` setting in `config.yaml`.
### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where deleted Teams did not disappear from the Software UI until you refreshed the page
- Fixed an issue where Teams were still available in the Software UI even when their underlying IDP group had been deleted from the IDP
- Fixed an issue where creating a Deployment with the default resource configuration would result in a Deployment having a **Scheduler Count** of 1 instead of the stated default of 2
- Fixed an issue where you could not deploy code to a Deployment that shared the release name of a previous Deployment which was hard deleted
- Fixed an issue where you could not create a Deployment with a numeric-only name in a pre-created namespace

## v0.28.3

### Import Identity Provider User Groups as Teams

You now can import existing identity provider (IDP) groups into Astronomer Software as Teams, which are groups of Astronomer users that have the same set of permissions to a given Workspace or Deployment. Importing existing IDP groups as Teams enables swift onboarding to Astronomer and better control over multiple user permissions.

For more information about configuring this feature, read [Import IDP Groups](import-idp-groups.md). To learn more about adding and setting permissions for Teams via the Astronomer UI, read [User Permissions](workspace-permissions.md#via-teams).

### Additional Improvements

- Astronomer now supports `prefer` and `require` SSL modes for connecting to PGBouncer. You can set this SSL mode via the `global.ssl.mode` value in your `config.yaml` file. Note that in v0.28.0, this feature works only with AWS and Azure.
- You can now set [Grafana environment variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/configuration/#override-configuration-with-environment-variables) using the `grafana.extraEnvVars` setting in your `config.yaml` file.
- Added a new **Ephemeral Storage Overwrite Gigabytes** slider to the Git Sync configuration screen. You can configure this slider to allocate more memory for syncing larger Git repos.
- Added a new **Sync Timeout** slider to the Git Sync configuration screen. You can configure this slider to set a maximum allowed length of time for syncing a Git repo.

### Custom OAuth Flows

You can now configure a custom OAuth flow as an alternative to Astronomer's default implicit flow. You can customize Astronomer's existing Okta, Google, and GitHub OAuth flows, or you can import an entirely custom OAuth flow. For more information, read [Configure a Custom OAuth Flow](integrate-auth-system.md#configure-a-custom-oauth-flow).

### Deploy DAGs via Git Sync

You can now configure a Git repo to continually push DAGs to an Astronomer Deployment via git-sync. DAGs deployed via git-sync automatically appear in the Airflow UI without requiring additional action or causing downtime. For more information, read [Deploy DAGs via Git Sync](deploy-git-sync.md).

### External ElasticSearch Logging

Custom ElasticSearch logging tools are now supported via new values in your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
# External ES logging
global:
  customLogging:
    enabled: true
    scheme: https
    host: ""
    port: ""
    secret: ""
    #secretName: ~
    #awsSecretName: ~
    #awsIAMRole: ~
    #awsServiceAccountAnnotation: ~
```

### CLI Support for Podman

By default, the Astronomer CLI uses Docker to execute a few specific commands. As an alternative, you can now configure the Astronomer CLI to use Podman instead. For more information, read [Run the CLI with Podman](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/configure-cli#run-the-astro-cli-using-podman).

## 0.26.4

Release date: November 22, 2021

### Support for Airflow 2.2.0

[Apache Airflow 2.2.0](https://airflow.apache.org/blog/airflow-2.2.0/) is an exciting milestone in the open source project. Most notably, this release introduces custom timetables and deferrable operators.

#### Custom Timetables

Timetables are a powerful new framework that you can use to create custom schedules using Python. In an effort to provide more flexibility and address known limitations imposed by cron, timetables use an intuitive `data_interval` that, for example, allows you to schedule a DAG to run daily on Monday through Friday, but not on the weekend. Timetables can be easily plugged into existing DAGs, which means that it's easy to create your own or use community-developed timetables in your project.

For more information on using timetables, read the [Apache Airflow Documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/timetable.html).

#### Deferrable Operators

Deferrable operators are a new type of Airflow operator that promises improved performance and lower resource costs. While standard operators and sensors take up a Worker or Scheduler slot even when they are waiting for an external trigger, deferrable operators are designed to suspend themselves and free up that Worker or Scheduler slot while they wait. This is made possible by a new, lightweight Airflow component called the Triggerer.

As part of supporting deferrable operators, you can provision multiple Triggerers on your Astronomer Deployments. By provisioning multiple Triggerers, you can ensure that tasks using Deferrable Operators are run even when one Triggerer goes down. For more information about configuring Triggerers and other resources, see [Configure a Deployment](configure-deployment.md).

### CLI Verbosity Flag

You can now specify a `--verbosity` flag for all Astronomer CLI commands. When you specify this flag with a CLI command, the CLI prints out [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) logs as the command runs. This is useful for debugging any errors that might result from a CLI command.

The flag prints out different levels of logs depending on the value that you pass it. Each possible value (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, and `panic`) maps to a different Logrus logging level. For more information about these logging levels, read the [Logrus documentation](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus#level-logging).

### Minor Improvements

- You can now create a custom set of cluster-level permissions for the Astronomer Commander service by setting `astronomer.global.clusterRoles: false` in your `config.yaml` file and pushing a new [RoleBinding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) to a pre-created Kubernetes namespace.
- In the `astronomer.houston.config` section of your `config.yaml` file, you can now configure a list of `allowedSystemLevelDomains []`. If you configure this list, only users with emails from domains specified in the list (for example, `<company>.com`) can be granted System Admin privileges.
- Greatly improved load times for the **System Admin** page in the UI.
- You can now specify a node port for 3rd party ingress controllers with a service type of `nodePort`.
- The naming format of service account pods has been changed from `<release-name>-dags-prod-worker-serviceaccount` to `release_name-dags-prod-airflow-worker`.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where you could not update an existing Deployment's IAM role via the Astronomer CLI
- Fixed an issue where Deployments would not work on clusters with custom domains
- Fixed error handling when interacting with a Deployment that wasn't fully spun up
- Added a new validation step for Airflow Helm chart values configured in the `astronomer.houston.config.deployments.helm.airflow` section of `config.yaml`
