Use this document to learn how you can connect an Astro cluster and its Deployments to your external GCP resources.

## Connection options

Publicly accessible endpoints allow you to quickly connect your Astro clusters or Deployments to GCP through an Airflow connection. If your cloud restricts IP addresses, you can add the external IPs of your Deployment or cluster to an GCP resource's allowlist. 

If you have stricter security requirements, you can [create a private connection](#create-a-private-connection-between-astro-and-gcp) to GCP in a few different ways.

After you crate a connection from your Deployment to GCP, you might also have to individually authorize Deployments to access specific resources. See [Authorize your Deployment using workload identity](authorize-deployments-to-your-cloud.md#gcp).

### Access a public GCP endpoint

To facilitate communication between your Astro cluster or Deployment and your cloud, you can allowlist the external IPs for your cluster or Deployment on your cloud. If you have no other security restrictions, this means that any Deployment or cluster with an allowlisted external IP address can access your GCP resources through a valid Airflow Connection.

#### Allowlist external IP addresses for a cluster

1. In the Cloud UI, click your Workspace name in the upper left corner, then click **Organization Settings**.
2. Click **Clusters**, then select a cluster.
3. In the Details page, copy the IP addresses listed under **External IPs**.
4. Add the IP addresses to the allowlist of any external services that you want your cluster to access.

After you allowlist a cluster's IP address, all Deployments in that cluster are allowed to access your external resources.

#### Allowlist external IP addresses for a Deployment

To grant access to your external resources on per-Deployment basis, or if you are using a standard cluster, allowlist the IPs only for specific Deployments. For each Deployment that you want to allowlist:

1. In the Cloud UI, select a Deployment, then click Details.
2. Copy the IP addresses under External IPs.
3. Add the IP addresses to the allowlist of any external services that you want your Deployment to access.

When you use publicly accessible endpoints to connect to GCP, traffic moves directly between your Astro cluster and the GCP API endpoint. Data in this traffic never reaches the Astronomer-managed control plane.

### Create a private connection between Astro and GCP

Choose one of the following setups based on the security requirements of your company and your existing infrastructure.

:::info 

This connection option is available only for dedicated Astro Hosted clusters and Astro Hybrid.

VPC peering ensures private and secure connectivity, reduces network transit costs, and simplifies network layouts.

To create a VPC peering connection between an Astro VPC and a GCP VPC: 
 
1. Contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support) and provide the following information:

    - Astro cluster ID and name.
    - Google Cloud project ID of the target VPC.
    - VPC NAME of the target VPC.
    - Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block of the target VPC.

    After receiving your request, Astronomer support will create a VPC peering connection from your Astro VPC to your target VPC. The support team will then provide you with your Astro cluster GCP project ID and VPC name.
    
2. Using the information provided by Astronomer support, [create a peering connection](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-vpc-peering#creating_a_peering_configuration) from your target VPC to your Astro cluster VPC. For example, you can use the following gcloud CLI command to create the connection:

   ```bash
   gcloud compute networks peerings create <choose-any-name> --network=<your-target-vpc-network-name>  --peer-project=<your-cluster-project-id> --peer-network=<your-cluster-vpc-name>
   ```

After both VPC peering connections have been created, the connection becomes active.

<TabItem value="Private Service Connect">

Use Private Service Connect (PSC) to create private connections from Astro to GCP services without connecting over the public internet. See [Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect) to learn more.

Astro clusters are by default configured with a PSC endpoint with a target of [All Google APIs](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-apis#supported-apis). To provide a secure-by-default configuration, a DNS zone is created with a resource record that will route all requests made to `*.googleapis.com` through this PSC endpoint. This ensures that requests made to these services are made over PSC without any additional user configuration. As an example, requests to `storage.googleapis.com` will be routed through this PSC endpoint.

A list of Google services and their associated service names are provided in the [Google APIs Explorer Directory](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer). Alternatively, you can run the following command in the Google Cloud CLI to return a list of Google services and their associated service names:

```bash
gcloud services list --available --filter="name:googleapis.com"
```
