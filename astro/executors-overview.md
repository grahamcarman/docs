The Airflow executor determines which worker resources run your scheduled tasks. 

On Astro, every Deployment requires an executor and you can change the executor at any time. After you choose an executor for an Astro Deployment, you can configure your DAGs and Deployment resources to maximize the executor's efficiency and performance. Use the information provided in this topic to learn how to configure the Celery and Kubernetes executors on Astro.

To learn more about executors in Airflow, see [Airflow executors](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/airflow-executors-explained).

## Choose an executor

The difference between executors is based on how tasks are distributed across worker resources. The executor you choose affects the infrastructure cost of a Deployment and how efficiently your tasks execute. Astro currently supports two executors, both of which are available in the Apache Airflow open source project:

- Celery executor
- Kubernetes executor

Read the following topics to learn about the benefits and limitations of each executor. For information about how to change the executor of an existing Deployment, see [Update the Deployment executor](configure-deployment-resources.md#update-the-deployment-executor).

### Celery executor

The Celery executor is the default for all new Deployments. It uses a group of workers, each of which can run multiple tasks at a time. Astronomer uses [worker autoscaling logic](celery-executor.md#celery-worker-autoscaling-logic) to determine how many workers run on your Deployment at a given time.

The Celery executor is a good option for some use cases. Specifically, the Celery executor is a good fit for your Deployment if:

- You do not have tasks that require more than 24 hours to execute
    - Celery workers give their tasks 24 hours to finish so they can restart in the event of a code deployment, though this can be alleviated with [DAG Deploys](deploy-dags.md).
- You want to use different worker types based on the type of task you're running. See [Configure worker queues](configure-worker-queues.md).
- You have a high number of short-running tasks
- Your tasks require the shortest startup latency (often milliseconds)
- You don't require task or dependency isolation
- You can configure and fine-tune your Celery workers per deployment

If you find that some tasks consume the resources of other tasks and cause them to fail, Astronomer recommends implementing worker queues or moving to the Kubernetes executor.

See [Manage the Celery executor](celery-executor.md) to learn more about how to configure the Celery executor.

### Kubernetes executor

The Kubernetes executor runs each task in an individual container. For each task that needs to run, the executor dynamically launches a Kubernetes Pod on your Astro Cluster for the task. When the task completes, the Pod terminates and its resources are released to the cluster. 

On Astro, the Kubernetes infrastructure required to run the Kubernetes executor is built into every Deployment and is managed by Astronomer.

The Kubernetes executor is a good option for some use cases. Specifically, the Kubernetes executor is a good fit for your Deployment if:

- You have long-running tasks that may require more than 24 hours to execute.
- Your tasks are compute-intensive or you are processing large volumes of data within the task. Kubernetes executor tasks run separately in a dedicated Pod per task. 
- Your tasks can tolerate some startup latency (often seconds)
- Your tasks require task or dependency isolation.
- You have had issues running certain tasks reliably with the Celery executor.

You can specify the configuration of the task's Pod, including CPU and memory, as part of your DAG definition using the [Kubernetes Python Client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python) and the `pod_override` arg.

If you're running a high task volume or cannot tolerate startup latency, Astronomer recommends the Celery executor. To learn more about using the Kubernetes executor, see [Manage the Kubernetes executor](kubernetes-executor.md).

:::tip

If only some of your tasks need an isolated execution environment, consider using the [KubernetesPodOperator](kubernetespodoperator.md) with the Celery executor.
