Office hours are a way for you to meet with Astronomer data engineers and ask about Astro and Airflow features and best practices . Office hours are available weekly on a first-come, first-served basis. An office hour session is typically 30 minutes long. 

:::caution

Office hours are not a replacement for support. [Submit a support request](astro-support.md) if you have any urgent issue, bug, or something that needs fixing. Astronomer data engineers will not be able to answer support requests during office hour sessions.

If you have questions about your Astronomer account or billing, email `success@astronomer.io` instead of attending office hours. If you need more extensive assistance, guidance, or regular long-term engagement, reach out to the [Professional Services](https://www.astronomer.io/professional-services/) team.
